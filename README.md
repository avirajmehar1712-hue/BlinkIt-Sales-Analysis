# Blinkit Sales Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes Blinkit’s sales dataset using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to uncover insights into sales performance across items, outlet types, and locations.  
The analysis includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations** to identify business opportunities.  

---

## Objectives  
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis  
- Explore key sales metrics and patterns  
- Compare sales performance by item attributes (type, fat content)  
- Analyze the impact of outlet characteristics (size, location, establishment year) on sales  
- Visualize findings using charts and plots  

---

## KPIs  
1. **Total Sales** – Overall revenue generated  
2. **Average Sales** – Mean revenue per transaction  
3. **Number of Items Sold** – Count of items across all outlets  
4. **Average Rating** – Mean customer rating of items

## Steps Performed  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked dataset size and structure  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Standardized categorical values (`LF`, `low fat` → `Low Fat`)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics of numerical and categorical features  
   - Value counts and distributions  

3. **Visualizations (Matplotlib)**  
   - Bar charts → Sales by item type, fat content, outlet type  
   - Grouped bar charts → Outlet tier vs. fat content sales  
   - Line charts → Sales by establishment year  
   - Pie → Sales by outlet size  
   - Horizontal bar charts → Top-performing categories

## Key Insights  
- Items with **Regular fat content** had higher sales than low-fat items  
- **Tier 3 outlets** generated the highest revenue  
- **Medium-sized outlets** performed better than small outlets  
- **Snacks, dairy, and frozen foods** contributed the most to overall sales
